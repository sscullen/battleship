""" battleship_game.py

This is a basic implementation of the Battleship boardgame. There are 
2 players, each with 1 ship. Players place their ships using coordinate tuples 
on a 8 x 8 grid (A-H x 1-8). The ships are 3 spaces long, so a valid placement 
would be (B2,D2). Once the ships are placed, players take turns shooting at 
coordinates. Once a player destroys the enemy ship, they win!

Structure of the objects involved. 

Player class
    holds the Board for that player
    holds the Ship(s) for that player
    additional metadata about the player
Board class
    keeps track of the hits and misses for each player
Ship class
    keeps track of the location of the ships for each player
    logic for hit or miss
    logic for ship destroyed
